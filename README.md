# Data Structures

A data structure is a storage used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

## Data Structures explored in this folder

- Binary Search Tree structure - A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a particular type of data structure in computer science that organizes data for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching. Operations like insertion, deletion, and search can be performed in O(log n) time complexity in a binary search tree, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is assuming that the tree is balanced. In the worst-case scenario, where the tree becomes skewed (more like a linked list), the time complexity of these operations could degrade to O(n).

- Doubly Linked Lists - A doubly linked list is a type of linked list in which each node contains a data element and two links pointing to the next and the previous node in the sequence, respectively. This allows for a greater variety of O(1) time complexity operations, such as insertions or deletions from both ends of the list, or the ability to iterate the list in both directions.

- Singly Linked Lists - A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes that together represent a sequence. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The linked list structure uses dynamic memory but not dynamic arrays
